                     with telephone booster or to a control condition; participants self-administered a

            <p id="d1e163">
               According to a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report, the worldwide average
               alcohol consumption per person (among 15 and older) in 2010 was 6.2 liters (
               <a href="#bib1" id="example" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Some tooltip text!">WHO, 2014</a>
               ). Of particular concern, in 10 countries the average consumption exceeded 13 or more
               liters per person, with nearly all of these countries located in Eastern Europe, including
               Russia and other former Soviet Union nations such as Belarus, Lithuania, Moldova,
               and Ukraine. For example, in Ukraine, residents consumed 13.9 liters on average. Even
               more concerning, the pattern of drinking score (PDS), which reflects the alcohol-attributable
               burden of disease based on risky drinking patterns (e.g., quantity, festive drinking,
               proportion getting drunk, daily consumption), is highest in the world in the Ukraine
               and Russia. 
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e168">
               In terms of cultural context, emerging adults are a particularly interesting cohort
               to examine in the Ukraine given that these youths were born following the collapse
               of the Soviet Union in 1991 and there is ongoing current conflict with Russia. Specifically,
               in 2014 Russian invaded eastern Ukraine, annexing Crimea and occupying eastern regions
               the country (as of April 2016), with nearly 9000 deaths and 20,000 injured thus far
               according to the United Nations. The conflict has also negatively affected the economy,
               including slowed economic growth and increases in inflation. In terms of alcohol use,
               the effects of the current conflict are largely unknown.  In 2013, data published
               from the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey shows about 4 in 10 males and 1
               in 10 females drank alcohol in the last month, with typical age of initiation being
               10 – 13 years old. Notably, 60% of poisoning among youth in the Ukraine was caused
               by alcohol (
               <a href="#bib3">Dvoretskaia, 2013</a>
               ). Although the legal drinking age in the Ukraine is 18 years old, beer was not legally
               classified as an alcoholic beverage until 2010 legislation was passed restricting
               access to low alcohol content beverages (e.g., beer).  Underscoring the need for efforts
               to prevent and reduce risky drinking among emerging adults, recent neuroscience research
               shows that binge drinking may interfere with neuromaturational development of brain.

               Early intervention for emerging adults with risky drinking may be a more effective
               use of resources than exclusive focus on treatment of those with alcohol use disorders
               (
               <a href="#bib4">Nathan, 1998</a>
               ). A pilot study conducted in the Ukraine surveyed emerging adults in an inpatient
               hospital and found that most did not think they had an alcohol problem; this study
               also found that common motives for alcohol use were related to coping with negative
               affect (e.g., stress, anxiety) and social influences (e.g., because my friends use
               alcohol) (
               <a href="#bib5">Polshkova et al., 2016</a>
               ).  These findings are similar to that of American studies with college students,
               in which common motives for drinking included: coping-anxiety, coping-depression,
               social, enhancement, and conformity. In this regard, brief motivational
               interventions (BMIs) may be useful to enhance desire to change behavior and address
               motives for use in order to reduce risk of future alcohol problems.

               In spite of the available literature from the United States regarding the efficacy
               of alcohol brief interventions (BIs) among emerging adults (

               <a href="#bib8">Carey et al., 2012</a>
               ), there is a critical lack of information about efficacy of BIs to reduce alcohol
               use among emerging adults in Ukraine. In Europe, a few studies have examined efficacy
               of BIs. Specifically, a German study provided a BI to medically referred alcohol intoxicated
               adolescents and emerging adults and examined the differences between “help accepters”
               and “help avoiders” with regard to socio-demographic characteristics and substance
               use patterns. Although promising, this study did not include a control group; thus,
               the efficacy of the BI remains to be determined. Another study conducted in the Czech
               Republic showed a BI reduced cannabis use, but not alcohol use, among adolescents
               in primary care in this regard, the authors noted cultural factors a potential barrier,
               including a drinking age of 18.

               Thus, there remain unanswered questions around the effectiveness of BIs across different

               alcohol BI from the U.S. (Cunningham et al., 2014) and conducted parallel pilot studies
               in a university and an inpatient hospital setting.  Primary hypotheses were that youth
               in the BI conditions would report significantly less alcohol consumption and consequences
               than youth in the control condition.  Secondary analyses examined outcomes for other
               variables, including drug use consequences, depression and anxiety levels, sleep disorders,
               aggression, and quality of life.  Findings provide novel data regarding the efficacy

               <p id="d1e242">
                  The BI was delivered using a motivational interviewing framework, in which a team
                  of four psychologists and/or psychiatrists explored the participant’s motivation to
                  change, as opposed to being prescriptive to a specific course of action (
                  <a href="#bib21">Miller and Rollnick, 2002</a>
                  ), with ambivalence about change being viewed as dynamic and common. The BI session
                  consisted of a 50 minute in-person session at a baseline visit (see below: Step 1
                  and Step 2), structured using a booklet.  Then, we conducted a 10-15 minute booster
                  session (2-4 weeks after baseline visit) when we called the participant and supported
                  them (Step 3). Given expected ambivalence, the BI and booster elicited the participant’s
                  perspective about stopping or changing their alcohol use (
                  <a href="#bib22">Miller et al., 2003</a>
                  ), while avoiding stigmatizing them as alcoholics, problem drinkers, or in denial.
                  Instead, the session were based on the premise that if participants do not feel judged,
                  most will be open to at least discussing their alcohol or drug use and possibly considering
                  the goal of avoiding future injuries and hospitalization.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e250">
                  Our BI included three steps. The first step was “Ask About Alcohol Use and Assess”.
                  We asked our participants “Do you sometimes drink beer, wine, or other alcoholic beverages?”
                  Considering the fact that all participants included into the study drank alcohol (inclusion
                  criteria), they answered “Yes”. The next question was about heavy drinking days: “How
                  many times in the past year have you had more than 4 drinks in a day? We tried to
                  determine whether, in the past 12 months, our participants' drinking has repeatedly
                  caused or contributed to risk of bodily harm (drinking and driving, operating machinery,
                  swimming), relationship trouble (family or friends), role failure (interference with
                  home, work, or school obligations), or run-ins with the law (arrests or other legal
                  problems). One or more positive answers may indicate alcohol abuse. Also, we identified
                  whether, in the past 12 months, our participants have not been able to stick to drinking
                  limits or cut down/stop drinking, shown tolerance or signs of withdrawal, kept drinking
                  despite problems, spent a lot of time drinking, and less time on other matters. Three
                  or more positive answers may indicate alcohol dependence whereas fewer positive answers
                  may indicate risky drinking. Thus, during this step we tried to understand the nature
                  of their alcohol problems and raise the possible of change as a possibility in order
                  to proceed to the next step.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e252">
                  The second step was “Advise and Assist”. We summarized consequences and medical concerns,
                  made recommendations for reducing or stopping drinking, and identified their readiness
                  to change drinking habits. If the participant was ready to commit to change, we helped
                  to set a goal, agreed on a plan and provided them with educational materials. If not,
                  we restated our concerns, encouraged reflections, identified barriers to change, and
                  reaffirmed our willingness to help.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e254">
                  The third step was “Continue Support”.  At this stage, we tried to determine if the
                  participant was able to meet and sustain the chosen drinking goal. If yes, we reinforced
                  and supported continued adherence to recommendations, renegotiating drinking goals
                  as indicated (e.g., if the medical condition changes or if an abstaining patient wishes
                  to resume drinking), encouraged them to return if unable to maintain goal, with recommendations
                  for rescreening at least annually. If not, we acknowledged that changes are difficult,
                  supported positive changes and addressed barriers, renegotiated goals and plans, considered
                  a trial of abstinence and engaging significant others, and reassessed diagnosis if
                  they were unable to either cut down or abstain.

               <p id="d1e277">
                  Regression analyses were conducted, separately for each setting, predicting alcohol
                  outcomes (consumption, non-drinking days and consequences); models controlled for
                  baseline alcohol levels and condition assignment (brief intervention or control).
                  In the combined sample, the brief intervention group showed significantly less alcohol
                  consumption and consequences and more non-drinking days at 3-months as compared to
                  the control group (p&lt;.001).  Note that these findings were also significant when examining
                  the hospital and university samples separately. Also, we examined efficacy separately
                  for males and females; as compared to the control, the BI reduced alcohol consumption,
                  consequences, and increased non-drinking days for both males and females (data available
                  upon request) (<a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>).

                  However, when examining other drug use (DAST-10 score), the brief intervention groups
                  were not significantly different from the control groups when examined together, or
                  separately based on the hospital or university sample (not presented). Finally, exploratory
                  analyses showed that there were significant decreases of depression, anxiety, physical
                  aggression, verbal aggression, anger, hostility, number of sexual partners and sensation
                  seeking in the BI group as compared to the control group; quality of life significantly
                  increased in the BI group as compared to the control group. Note that these outcomes
                  were consistent for the hospital and university samples for all variables except for
                  sexual partners, which significantly decreased in the hospital sample but not the
                  university sample (data available upon request). Finally, findings for the efficacy

                  and females (data available upon request), with no significant effects on drug use
                  outcomes, and significant effects on the other variables described above.

               Data from this pilot study contributes to the literature by examining screening and
               brief intervention approaches adapted to a specific cultural context, namely emerging
               adulthood in the Ukraine. Although replication is required, results suggest that BI
               approaches may be efficacious for reducing risky drinking and consequences in the
               short term (e.g., 3-months) among emerging adults in both university and inpatient
               hospital settings.  In addition to being the first of study on this topic in the Ukraine,
               this study also explored intervention effects on other outcomes to help understand
               potential mechanisms underlying changes following BI.  Together, these findings inform
               research and clinical practice to enhance early identification in order to potentially
               alter problematic alcohol use trajectories among emerging adults in the Ukraine. 
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e289">
               Data from this pilot study showed that as compared to a control condition, the BI,
               which included a telephone booster, reduced alcohol consumption and consequences,
               and increased non-drinking days, among both the university and hospital samples. Thus,
               even though clinician’s noted that patients the hospital sample seemed more receptive
               to the BI, whereas the university students were less enthusiastic, both samples reduced
               their alcohol consumption. The sample differences, in which students were younger
               and single, did not appear to affect the efficacy of the BI on alcohol outcomes. These
               findings are consistent with the literature in which BIs are effective for reducing
               alcohol consumption in clinic and university samples (
               <a href="#bib6">Spirito et al., 2004</a>; 
               <a href="#bib7">Foxcroft et al., 2014</a>; 
               <a href="#bib8">Carey et al., 2012</a>
               ). It is important to note that 100% of participants received the assigned BI and
               the booster, and the follow-up, potentially reflecting cultural norms in which patients
               and students comply with the requests of their doctors; alternatively, given the limited
               availability of services, these “free” services were viewed as beneficial. Such high
               rates of compliance have been found in other countries formerly part of the Soviet
               Union (e.g., Czech Republic). 
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e300">
               Although primary outcomes related to alcohol were reduced following the BI, there
               were no effects upon drug use, as measured by DAST-10 score and non-drug use days.
               These findings could reflect the focus of the intervention on alcohol use, and the
               screen-- which was for risky drinking. Also, the study was limited in that no questions
               were asked regarding specific illicit or prescription drug used. In this regard, clinicians
               anecdotally noted that other drug use was fairly uncommon, consisting mostly of the
               use of sedative medications, which do not require a doctor’s prescription.  Future
               studies are needed to determine how this intervention can be adapted to reduce other
               drug use in the Ukraine.  Another BI study in the Czech Republic did not reduce alcohol
               use among a younger sample of adolescents, but did reduce other drug use.  It may
               be that the focus on the intervention is important as research shows BIs only reduce
               targeted substances, even when multiple substances are targeted. For example, when
               alcohol and cannabis were targeted, both were reduced.

               When translating the evidenced BI from the U.S. to the Ukraine, sensitivity to several
               cultural issues had to be considered. To begin, it was important to translate the
               interventions into the multiple languages used within countries, in this case Ukrainian
               and Russian, to increase comfort in the discussion of sensitive topics. Also, given
               the ongoing conflict with Russia that occurred during the time the BIs were delivered,
               motives for drinking were important to discuss in the context of coping with anxiety
               and depression, due to economic instability and financial stressors as well as concerns
               for safety of loved ones. Also, it was important to discuss social support for abstinence,
               and reduced drinking, as it is uncommon for young people to abstain in Ukraine. Under
               the war conditions in the Ukraine, young people may be particularly receptive to BIs
               which are “free” care, which may explain the positive outcomes from the BI found in
               this study.  Future studies are needed during peacetime conditions.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e304">
               We explored the effects of the BIs on other related factors to provide clues to potential
               mechanisms of BI effects. Caution is required when interpreting these findings, however,
               given their exploratory nature, the small sample size, and the design, which precluded
               complex statistical modeling (e.g., mediation/moderation) and causal determination.
               As compare to the controls, the BI reduced depression, anxiety, anger, aggression,
               and sensation seeking, but increased quality of life.  These findings are consistent
               with the focus of the BI, which included alternatives for coping with negative affect
               and alternative ways to have fun and enjoy life. Future research is needed to examine
               the importance of these factors in sustaining reductions in drinking.

               Several limitations require acknowledgement. To begin, data was collected by self-report,
               thus reactivity (e.g., underreporting, participants wanting to please) can’t be entirely
               eliminated. However, the fact that assessments were self-administered partly alleviates
               this concern. Still, it may be that participants in the BI condition, who could not
               be blind to condition assignment, underreported because they did not believe their
               data would be confidential, that is, kept private from their clinicians. Culturally,
               mistrust of government and disbelief of privacy is a common perspective among many
               Ukrainians. On the other hand, the control group did not show reductions in alcohol
               related outcomes, and thus appeared to believe their answers were confidential.  Although
               they did not receive a BI, they did answer questions about alcohol use and receive
               a brochure. Regardless, the sample size was small, and representativeness can’t be
               established; thus, replication is required with additional longitudinal follow-ups
               to determine whether initial efficacy is sustained. Nonetheless, given that this is
               the first BI study in the Ukraine, the data presented are novel and make an important
               contribution to the literature.

            <p id="d1e311">
               Ideally, clinicians should be knowledgeable about substance abuse to be able to recognize
               risk factors for alcohol and other substance use among adolescents and emerging adults,
               screen for use, provide appropriate brief interventions, and refer to treatment [23,24].
               Once replicated, study findings support the integration of alcohol use prevention
               programs into the medical and educational system among emerging adults in the Ukraine.
               Further research is needed to replicate and extend these promising findings with other
               samples of adolescents and emerging adults in various healthcare and educational settings
               in Ukraine.
